    <p>Problems I faced while making this:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Page was refreshing on submit, so had to add the onsubmit attribute to form and set it's value to "return false"</li>
        <li>Saving values of input fields before event listeners is not useful as they as saved as soon as the page loads, so we initiatilize them within the event handler, and not store them in a variable at the start of our  script.</li>
    </ol>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
